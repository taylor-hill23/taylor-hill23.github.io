I am a political science student at [Florida State University](https://cosspp.fsu.edu/polisci/). My research interests are in American Politics, specifically voting behavior, economic voting, democratic backsliding, the effects of political discussion, and affective polarization. I am also passionate about political methodology especially experimental design.
