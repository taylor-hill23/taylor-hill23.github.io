I am a political science PhD student at [Florida State University](https://cosspp.fsu.edu/polisci/). My research interests are in American Politics. I am interested in voting behavior, economic voting, democratic backsliding in the U.S., and what voters consider when supporting undemocratic candidates at the ballot box. I am also interested in how political discussions with those we disagree with affect partisan animosity and how to increase opportunities for individuals to engage in such discussions. Methodologically, I am interested in quantitative research, especially experimental design. As experiments continue to become popular in the social sciences, I am interested in discovering solutions to make experiments more valid in answering the important questions we ask as political scientists.
