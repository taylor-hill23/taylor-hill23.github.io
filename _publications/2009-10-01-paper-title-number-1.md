This paper focuses on how religious respondents react to contrasting political cues. We test how members of the LDS faith faced conflicting political cues from their religious leaders and their party leaders about COVID-19 vaccinations. We found that in this case, members of this faith followed the counsel of their religious leaders in making a political choice.
